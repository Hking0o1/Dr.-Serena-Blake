        {
        question: "Do you accept insurance?",
        answer: "No, but a superbill is provided for self-submission to your insurance company for potential reimbursement."
        },
        {
        question: "Are online sessions available?",
        answer: "Yesâ€”all virtual sessions are conducted via Zoom with secure, HIPAA-compliant technology."
        },
        {
        question: "What is your cancellation policy?",
        answer: "24-hour notice is required for cancellations. Late cancellations or no-shows may be charged the full session fee."
        },
        {
        question: "How do I know if therapy is right for me?",
        answer: "Therapy can be beneficial for anyone looking to improve their mental health, work through challenges, or gain new perspectives on life situations. If you're experiencing persistent stress, anxiety, depression, relationship issues, or simply want to understand yourself better, therapy can provide valuable support and tools for growth."
        },
        {
        question: "What should I expect in my first session?",
        answer: "Your first session is an opportunity for us to get to know each other. We'll discuss your goals for therapy, your current concerns, and your background. I'll explain my approach and answer any questions you have about the therapeutic process. This session helps us determine if we're a good fit and create a plan moving forward."
        },
        {
        question: "How long does therapy typically take?",
        answer: "The length of therapy varies greatly depending on your individual needs and goals. Some people benefit from short-term therapy (8-12 sessions) for specific issues, while others find longer-term therapy helpful for deeper work. We'll regularly check in about your progress and adjust our approach as needed."
        },
        {
        question: "Is everything I share in therapy confidential?",
        answer: "Yes, confidentiality is a cornerstone of therapy. Everything you share is kept strictly confidential, with very few exceptions required by law (such as imminent danger to yourself or others). We'll discuss these limits during our first session so you feel completely informed and comfortable."
        },
        {
        question: "Do you accept insurance, and what are your fees?",
        answer: "I work with most major insurance providers and also offer self-pay options. Fees vary depending on the type of session and your insurance coverage. I believe everyone deserves access to mental health care, so please don't hesitate to discuss financial concerns with me. We can work together to find an arrangement that works for your situation."
